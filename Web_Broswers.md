# Key Components & Functions of Web Broswers

## **How do browsers use protocols like HTTP or HTTPS to access websites?**
- Browsers use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with and access web servers and websites.
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is a more secure version of HTTP.
- Browsers send an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server, which includes metadata like browser type and personal preferences.
- HTTPS has an extra step: establishing a secure connection using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/TLS encryption (Transport Layer Security).
    - SSL is an older encryption protocol that is less secure and largely outdated in the modern day.
    - TLS is the newer/modern version of SSL that is more secure and widely used in the modern day.
- When a HTTP(S) request is processed the server will respond with the requested resource.

## **How do browsers help fix internet performance issues like slow-loading pages or big images?**
- Storing copies of frequently accessed resources locally, in a process called caching. This reduces the need to redownload said resources on every visit, speeding up website load time.
- Browsers will compress resources sent by the server, reducing the size and download times.
- Browsers will only load critical content (like on screen images) when needed, in a process called lazy loading.
- Browsers minimize bandwidth usage by using content optimizers, which decrease the size of an image while retaining its quality.
